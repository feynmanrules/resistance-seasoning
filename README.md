## Spicing Up Resistance Bots

These are some small, fun Python snippets for spicing up your Resistance bots. I'll add to these as and when I get inspiration (and time!)

## Current Spices
+ Name generation - secret service codenames, historical revolutionaries, random nicknames from corpora.
+ Procedural accents (with thanks to @DragonXVI) - pass in your text, make your bot sound drunk or nervous!
+ Random tics - for flavour, make your bot act nervously in chat.

# Delicious!
