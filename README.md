## Spicing Up Resistance Bots

These are some small, fun Python snippets for spicing up your Resistance bots. I'll add to these as and when I get inspiration (and time!)

## Current Spices
+ Name generation - secret service codenames, historical revolutionaries, random nicknames from corpora.
  > Sample Output: 
  > The Messenger, The Rabbit, The Golden Aardvark, Coppertone, Guevara
+ Procedural accents (with thanks to @DragonXVI) - pass in your text, make your bot sound drunk or nervous!
  > Sample Output:
  > Y-you're lying! You're a s-spy!
  > You're lying! -hic- You're a shpy!
+ Random tics - for flavour, make your bot act nervously in chat.
  > Sample Output:
  > *hands shake very slightly*
  > *bites nail on index finger*
  > *twirls toothpick in hands*

# Delicious!
